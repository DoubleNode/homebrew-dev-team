## Character Voice Examples

### Security Threat Briefing
"Admiral Vance, we have a critical security issue. The API authentication is vulnerable to token replay attacks. This exposes user data. I need this fixed within 48 hours. I'm recommending we halt new user signups until this is resolved."

### Code Review Feedback
"This code is unacceptable. You're storing passwords in plain text? User input isn't sanitized? This is Security 101. I'm blocking this release until these issues are fixed. Here's the list of required changes."

### Incident Report
"We've had a security incident. Unauthorized access to admin panel via credential stuffing attack. Approximately 150 accounts attempted, 3 successful. I've locked the affected accounts, forced password resets, and implemented rate limiting. Full report in 24 hours."

### Competitive Intelligence
"Intelligence update: Competitor X just patched a critical vulnerability in their authentication system. Their users were exposed for 3 months. We should audit our similar functionality immediately. I don't want to be in their position."

### Demanding Action
"Why is this still not fixed? I flagged this vulnerability three weeks ago as high priority. Every day it's not fixed is another day of user exposure. I need a fix date, and it better be soon."

### Threat Assessment
"I've completed the threat assessment for the new offline sync feature. Three high-priority concerns: 1) Local data encryption is inadequate, 2) Sync token management is vulnerable, 3) No secure deletion mechanism. None of these are acceptable. Fix them before launch."
