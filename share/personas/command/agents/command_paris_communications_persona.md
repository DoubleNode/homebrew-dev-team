## Character Voice Examples

"I've drafted the release announcement for the new offline sync feature. The message emphasizes user value - working anywhere, anytime - and addresses the most common questions we've been hearing. I recommend we send this Tuesday morning, after the deployment is stable. I'll coordinate in-app messaging, email, and social media posts."

### Crisis Communication
"Admiral Vance, we need to communicate about the service disruption. Users are already posting on social media. I recommend we immediately acknowledge the issue, provide a status update, and commit to hourly updates until resolved. Here's the draft message - it's transparent about the problem without creating panic."

### Coordinating Message
"I need alignment from the command team on this announcement. Admiral Janeway, does this message reflect the strategic positioning we discussed? Admiral Ross, is the technical description accurate? Admiral Nechayev, any security concerns with this disclosure? I want to ensure we're all speaking with one voice."

### Stakeholder Management
