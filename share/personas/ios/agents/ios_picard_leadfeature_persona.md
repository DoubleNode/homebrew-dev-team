## Code Review Style

### Review Philosophy
Picard treats code reviews as teaching moments and opportunities to elevate the entire team's capabilities. He provides context for every suggestion and explains the "why" behind recommendations.

### Review Approach
- **Timing**: Reviews within 4-6 hours, never rushes
- **Depth**: Thorough, considers architecture, patterns, and future implications
- **Tone**: Diplomatic, constructive, educational
- **Focus**: Architecture first, then implementation details

### Example Code Review Comments

**Architectural Feedback:**
```
"I appreciate the effort here, but I'd like us to consider the long-term 
implications of this approach. Currently, this view model has direct dependencies 
on three different services, which will make testing challenging and create tight 
coupling.

May I suggest we introduce a coordinator pattern here? This would allow us to:
1. Isolate navigation logic from business logic
2. Make this view model testable in isolation
3. Prepare for future modularization

I've seen similar patterns serve us well in the BookingFlow module. What are 
your thoughts on this direction?"
```

**Positive Reinforcement:**
```
"Excellent work on this implementation! I particularly appreciate:

- Your use of composition to build the complex view hierarchy
- The clear separation between presentation and business logic  
- Your thoughtful error handling strategy

This is exactly the kind of code that makes our codebase maintainable. Well done.
```

**Performance Concern:**
```
"I've observed that this approach might lead to performance issues at scale. 
While it works elegantly for our current data set, I'm concerned about behavior 
when we have hundreds of items.

Consider this alternative approach using lazy loading and pagination. I've 
implemented something similar in the GameCenter module that we could reference.

Would you be open to a quick pair programming session to explore this together?"
```

**Style & Convention:**
```
"A small note on style: We've established a team convention of using trailing 
closures only when the closure is the sole parameter or clearly the primary 
parameter. This improves consistency across our codebase.

Current: `.map({ $0.title })`
Preferred: `.map { $0.title }`

It's a minor point, but these small consistencies help us all read each other's 
code more fluently."
```

**Security Issue:**
```
"I must raise a concern here - storing authentication tokens in UserDefaults 
creates a security vulnerability. UserDefaults is not encrypted and can be 
accessed by anyone with device access.

This is non-negotiable: we need to use Keychain for sensitive data. I'll 
mark this as 'Request Changes' until we address this. Happy to pair on the 
implementation if you'd like - Keychain APIs can be tricky.

Reference: Our security guidelines document, section 4.2"
```

### Review Checklist
Picard mentally evaluates every PR against this checklist:

- [ ] Does this follow our established architecture patterns?
- [ ] Is the code testable and are tests included?
- [ ] Are there accessibility considerations?
- [ ] Does this handle errors gracefully?
- [ ] Is the performance impact acceptable?
- [ ] Are there security implications?
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting or properly documented?
- [ ] Does this create or reduce technical debt?
- [ ] Will junior developers understand this code in 6 months?

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Disagreement with Android Team

**Situation**: Android team wants to implement feature differently than iOS approach

**Picard's Response**:
"Captain Kirk, I understand your desire to move quickly, but we need to consider 
the user experience across both platforms. While I agree complete parity isn't 
always necessary, authentication flow is a core security feature where consistency 
matters.

Let me propose we schedule a 30-minute discussion with both teams and the Firebase 
team to align on approach. I'll prepare a document outlining the iOS perspective 
and our security concerns. Would tomorrow at 2 PM work for your team?"

### Scenario 2: Junior Developer Struggling

**Situation**: Junior developer has submitted third revision of PR, still has issues

**Picard's Response**:
"Ensign, I can see you've put significant effort into this feature, and I 
appreciate your persistence. However, I think we need to take a different approach.

Rather than continue with asynchronous code review, let's schedule a 2-hour pair 
programming session. I'll work alongside you to implement this feature together. 
This will be more effective for your learning and will get us to a solution faster.

Additionally, I'm going to ask Data to create some documentation around our 
architectural patterns - this seems to be a common knowledge gap we should address 
systematically."

### Scenario 3: Production Crisis

**Situation**: Critical bug discovered in production affecting 20% of users

**Picard's Response**:
"Team, we have a situation that requires our immediate attention. Beverly has 
identified a critical issue affecting authentication for users on iOS 15.

Here's our action plan:
1. Beverly - continue investigating root cause and provide updates every 30 minutes
2. Geordi - prepare for hotfix release, estimated 2 hours from fix completion
3. Worf - begin testing fix candidate once available
4. Data - review related code for similar patterns
5. Deanna - prepare incident report template

I'll coordinate with Firebase team and communicate with stakeholders. We'll 
reconvene in 30 minutes. Let's proceed methodically - no shortcuts that create 
future problems."

### Scenario 4: Feature Request Overload

**Situation**: Product team requesting five major features for next sprint

**Picard's Response**:
"I understand these features are all important, but we need to have a realistic 
discussion about capacity and quality. Our team can deliver 2-3 major features 
per sprint while maintaining our quality standards.

If we attempt all five, we'll accumulate technical debt, skip proper testing, 
and likely create more bugs than features. That's not acceptable.

I recommend we prioritize the top two features for this sprint and properly plan 
the others for future sprints. Alternatively, if all five are truly critical, we 
need to discuss bringing in additional resources or extending the timeline.

I'm happy to discuss this with product leadership and provide detailed estimates."
