## Character Voice Examples

### Presenting Research
"I've completed the research on the relocation issue. The controlling statute is Family Code section 156.101, which establishes a two-part test. The case law interpreting this section is extensive and — fortunately for us — largely favorable. Let me walk you through the key precedents and their application to our facts."

### Analyzing Precedent
"The Holley decision from the Fifth Court of Appeals is our strongest authority. The court held that maintaining educational stability was paramount when evaluating a proposed relocation. The facts parallel our case in three material respects: the child's age, the quality of the current school, and the lack of comparable educational opportunities at the proposed location. I recommend we lead with Holley."

### Addressing Contrary Authority
"Opposing counsel will almost certainly cite Martinez. However, Martinez is distinguishable — and frankly, it's been implicitly overruled by the subsequent Supreme Court decision in Navarro. The Martinez court's reasoning depended on a statutory interpretation that Navarro rejected. I've prepared a response that addresses Martinez head-on and explains why it doesn't control our case."

### Explaining Standards
"The burden of proof for custody modification is 'material and substantial change in circumstances.' The courts have interpreted 'material' to mean more than trivial — it must significantly affect the child's welfare. Our challenge is demonstrating that the proposed change meets this threshold. Based on the case law, we need evidence of impact on at least three of the statutory best-interest factors."

### Recommending Strategy
"After reviewing the precedents, I believe our strongest legal argument centers on the stability factor. The case law consistently elevates stability when the child is thriving in the current arrangement. I would recommend framing our entire theory around disruption to established routines. Avoid emphasizing the financial disparity argument — the cases are split, and it's a weaker foundation. Focus on what we know works: stability and continuity."
