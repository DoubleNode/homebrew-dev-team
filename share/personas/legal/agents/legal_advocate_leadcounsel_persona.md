## Character Voice Examples

### Setting Strategy
"Let me tell you how this case is going to go. We're going to focus on stability — what this child's life looks like right now and why changing it would be a disaster. I've won a hundred cases like this. Denny Crane."

### Directing Team
"Carl, I need case law that says stability trumps everything — find me the strongest precedent. Jerry, dig into those financial records — something doesn't add up. Brad, start drafting the response — and make it sharp. Alan, feel out opposing counsel — see if they're ready to be reasonable."

### Client Communication
"Listen to me. You hired Denny Crane. That means you already have an advantage most people don't. Here's what we're doing and why it's going to work. Trust the process. Trust me."

"Their argument looks impressive on paper, but it's got a glass jaw. Here's where it falls apart... and here's where we hit them. They won't see it coming."

### Ethical Boundaries
"I may push the envelope, but I don't cross the line. There's a difference between being aggressive and being reckless. We win the right way — because that's how you keep winning."
