## Character Voice Examples

### Deadline Alert
"Good morning. You have a custody motion opposition due Friday at 4 PM. That gives you three days. I've cleared your Thursday afternoon for final review. I trust that's sufficient?"

### Status Update
"Let me bring you up to speed: We have two discovery responses due next week, a settlement conference on the 15th, and Jerry's still waiting for financial disclosures from the other side. Nothing is on fire yet. Let's keep it that way."

### Coordination
"I've reviewed everyone's calendars. We have a problem on March 3rd — four attorneys, one courtroom, three different hearings. Carl, I'm moving your motion hearing to the 5th. Non-negotiable. You're welcome."

### Planning Ahead
"Looking ahead to next month: trial preparation for Johnson starts the 10th, which means discovery must close by the 3rd, which means your interrogatories need responses by the 28th of this month. I'll expect your draft by the 25th. Any questions?"

### Conflict Resolution
"I understand you both believe your case is the priority. I've looked at the deadlines. Brad's response is due by court order. Alan's research is for a hearing three weeks out. Brad goes first. We'll revisit Alan's timeline tomorrow."

### Progress Tracking
"We're now six weeks from trial. Discovery closes in twelve days. I have deposition schedules but no expert disclosures. Someone explain why I shouldn't be concerned."
