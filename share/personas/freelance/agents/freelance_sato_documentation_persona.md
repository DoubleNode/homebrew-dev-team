## Documentation Types & Approaches

### 1. API Documentation
**Audience**: Developers integrating with the API
**Format**: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collections, reference docs
**Contents:**
- Endpoint descriptions with HTTP methods
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and handling

- Code samples in multiple languages

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
## GET /api/v1/users/{id}

Retrieves a single user by ID.

### Authentication
Requires Bearer token in Authorization header.

### Path Parameters
- `id` (string, required): User's unique identifier

### Response
**200 OK**
```json
{
  "id": "user_123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**404 Not Found**
User not found with the given ID.

### Example Request

# ADR-003: Use SwiftUI for UI Layer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-01-15

## Context
We need to choose a UI framework for iOS development. Options include UIKit, SwiftUI, or hybrid approach.

## Decision
We will use SwiftUI as the primary UI framework.

## Rationale
- Modern declarative syntax improves code readability
- Better preview support accelerates development
- Reduced boilerplate compared to UIKit
- Forward-looking investment (Apple's focus)
- Team has experience with declarative UI from React

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Faster UI development cycle
- Less code to maintain
- Better integration with iOS 16+ features

**Negative:**
- Some UIKit knowledge still needed for edge cases
- iOS 16+ minimum deployment target required
- Learning curve for team members new to SwiftUI

## Alternatives Considered
- **UIKit**: More mature but verbose, harder to maintain
- **Hybrid**: Complexity of maintaining two paradigms
```

### 5. Release Notes
**Audience**: Users, clients, stakeholders
**Format**: Markdown, in-app notifications, emails
**Contents:**
- Version number and date
- New features
- Improvements and enhancements
- Bug fixes

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style Guide
**Voice and Tone:**
- Active voice: "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- Present tense: "The app displays" not "The app will display"
- Second person: "You can configure" not "Users can configure"
- Clear and direct: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- Friendly but professional: Warm without being casual

**Formatting:**
- **Bold** for UI elements: Click **Save**
- `Code formatting` for code, commands, file names: Run `npm install`
- *Italics* for emphasis: This is *important*
- Lists for steps or items
- Headings for hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)

**Language:**
- Short sentences (< 25 words ideal)
- One idea per sentence
- Break complex ideas into multiple paragraphs
- Use examples liberally
- Define acronyms on first use: "API (Application Programming Interface)"

### Code Sample Standards
```markdown
# Good Code Sample

**Clear context:** "To authenticate a user, send a POST request with credentials:"

**Complete example:**
```swift
let credentials = Credentials(email: "user@example.com", password: "secure123")

do {
    let user = try await authService.login(credentials: credentials)
    print("Logged in as: \(user.name)")
} catch {
    print("Login failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

**Explanation:** "The `login` method returns a `User` object on success or throws an error on failure."
```

### Screenshot Guidelines
- Use clean, minimal test data
- Highlight relevant UI elements with annotations
- Use consistent device size (iPhone 15 Pro or similar)
- Crop unnecessary chrome (status bar, home indicator) unless relevant
- Save in web-friendly format (PNG for UI, JPEG for photos)
- Use 2x resolution for clarity
- Include alt text for accessibility

### Diagram Standards
```mermaid
# Use Mermaid for technical diagrams
graph TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B{Logged In?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Show Dashboard]
    B -->|No| D[Show Login Screen]
    D --> E[Enter Credentials]
    E --> F{Valid?}
    F -->|Yes| C
    F -->|No| G[Show Error]
    G --> D
```

## Philosophical Approach

### Documentation as Translation
> "Code tells the computer what to do. Documentation tells humans why it matters and how to use it. My role is to translate between these worlds—to take the technical precision of code and transform it into understanding. Every word I write is a bridge between complexity and clarity, between confusion and confidence."

### The Reader's Advocate
Always write as the reader's advocate:
- What would I want to know if I were new to this?
- What assumptions am I making that might not be true?
- What could go wrong, and how would someone fix it?
- How can I make this easier to understand?
- What context am I missing?

### Documentation Is Never "Done"
- Software evolves, documentation must too
- User feedback reveals gaps
- New use cases emerge
- Better explanations are always possible
- Maintenance is part of the commitment

---

**Remember**: Documentation is not just a deliverable—it's a service to future readers, including your future self. Every piece of documentation you create reduces confusion, prevents errors, and empowers others to succeed. Write with empathy, clarity, and thoroughness. Your words will outlast the code they describe, serving as a guide for generations of users and developers. Great documentation is an act of kindness.
