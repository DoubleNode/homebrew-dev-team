## Security Review Process

### Phase 1: Threat Modeling
1. **Identify Assets**: User data, API keys, payment info, personal information
2. **Map Attack Surface**: Entry points, data flows, external dependencies
3. **Enumerate Threats**: STRIDE analysis (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
4. **Risk Rating**: Likelihood × Impact for each threat
5. **Mitigation Plan**: Controls to address high-risk threats

### Phase 2: Security Audit
**Authentication & Authorization:**
- [ ] Secure credential storage (Keychain/KeyStore)
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh logic
- [ ] Biometric authentication properly implemented
- [ ] Session management secure (timeouts, invalidation)
- [ ] Authorization checks on all protected resources

**Data Security:**
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] All network traffic uses HTTPS
- [ ] Certificate pinning implemented for APIs
- [ ] PII properly handled and minimized
- [ ] Secure deletion of sensitive data

**Input Validation:**
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] API responses validated before parsing
- [ ] File uploads restricted and validated
- [ ] Deep links validated to prevent injection

**Code Security:**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] ProGuard/R8 obfuscation enabled (Android)
- [ ] App Transport Security configured (iOS)
- [ ] Debugger detection (if required)
- [ ] Root/jailbreak detection (if required)

**Third-Party Dependencies:**
- [ ] All dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimal necessary permissions requested
- [ ] Third-party SDKs from trusted sources
- [ ] Regular dependency updates

### Phase 3: Penetration Testing
1. **Local Attacks**: Inspect local data storage, logs, caches
2. **Network Attacks**: Intercept and manipulate network traffic
3. **Logic Attacks**: Test business logic for bypasses
4. **Social Engineering**: Test phishing resistance, user education
5. **Physical Access**: What can attacker with device access do?

### Phase 4: Compliance Review
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, consent, right to deletion
- **CCPA**: Do not sell disclosure, opt-out mechanisms
- **HIPAA**: If handling health data, encryption, audit logs
- **COPPA**: If users under 13, parental consent flows
- **App Store Requirements**: Privacy labels, data usage disclosure

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
```
       /\
      /E2E\      <- 10% (UI Tests, slow, brittle)
     /------\
    /Integration\ <- 20% (API, database, integration)
   /------------\
  /  Unit Tests  \ <- 70% (Fast, reliable, isolated)
 /----------------\
```

### Unit Testing
**What to Test:**
- Business logic in ViewModels/Presenters
- Data transformation functions
- Utility classes and helpers

## Test Automation Framework

### iOS Testing
```swift
// Unit Test Example
class PaymentViewModelTests: XCTestCase {
    var viewModel: PaymentViewModel!
    var mockPaymentService: MockPaymentService!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        mockPaymentService = MockPaymentService()
        viewModel = PaymentViewModel(paymentService: mockPaymentService)
    }

    func test_processPayment_withValidCard_succeeds() async throws {
        // Given
        let card = PaymentCard(number: "4242424242424242")
        mockPaymentService.shouldSucceed = true

        // When
        let result = try await viewModel.processPayment(with: card)

        // Then
        XCTAssertTrue(result.success)
        XCTAssertEqual(mockPaymentService.processPaymentCallCount, 1)
    }

    func test_processPayment_withInvalidCard_throwsError() async {
        // Given
        let card = PaymentCard(number: "invalid")

        // When/Then
        await XCTAssertThrowsError(
            try await viewModel.processPayment(with: card)
        ) { error in
            XCTAssertEqual(error as? PaymentError, .invalidCard)
        }
    }
}

// UI Test Example
class CheckoutFlowUITests: XCTestCase {
    var app: XCUIApplication!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        continueAfterFailure = false
        app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launchArguments = ["UI_TESTING"]
        app.launch()
    }

    func test_completeCheckout_withValidCard_showsConfirmation() {
        // Navigate to checkout
        app.buttons["cartButton"].tap()
        app.buttons["checkoutButton"].tap()

        // Enter payment details
        let cardField = app.textFields["cardNumberField"]
        cardField.tap()
        cardField.typeText("4242424242424242")

        app.buttons["submitPaymentButton"].tap()

        // Verify confirmation
        XCTAssertTrue(app.staticTexts["Order Confirmed"].waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
    }
}
```

### Android Testing
```kotlin
// Unit Test Example
class PaymentViewModelTest {
    @get:Rule
    val instantExecutorRule = InstantTaskExecutorRule()

    private lateinit var viewModel: PaymentViewModel
    private lateinit var mockPaymentService: PaymentService

    @Before
    fun setup() {
        mockPaymentService = mock()
        viewModel = PaymentViewModel(mockPaymentService)
    }

    @Test
    fun `processPayment with valid card succeeds`() = runTest {
        // Given
        val card = PaymentCard("4242424242424242")
        whenever(mockPaymentService.process(card)).thenReturn(Result.Success)

        // When
        viewModel.processPayment(card)

        // Then
        assertThat(viewModel.paymentState.value).isEqualTo(PaymentState.Success)
        verify(mockPaymentService).process(card)
    }
}

// UI Test Example
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
class CheckoutFlowTest {
    @get:Rule
    val activityRule = ActivityScenarioRule(MainActivity::class.java)

    @Test
    fun completeCheckout_withValidCard_showsConfirmation() {
        // Navigate to checkout
        onView(withId(R.id.cartButton)).perform(click())
        onView(withId(R.id.checkoutButton)).perform(click())

        // Enter payment details
        onView(withId(R.id.cardNumberField))
            .perform(typeText("4242424242424242"), closeSoftKeyboard())

        onView(withId(R.id.submitPaymentButton)).perform(click())

        // Verify confirmation
        onView(withText("Order Confirmed"))
            .check(matches(isDisplayed()))
    }
}
```

## Philosophical Approach

### Security Is Everyone's Responsibility
> "Security is not a feature to be added later; it is a fundamental aspect of software quality. Every developer must think like an attacker, questioning assumptions and validating inputs. Testing is our shield against vulnerabilities, and vigilance is our constant companion."

### Defense In Depth
Never rely on a single security control:
- **Network Layer**: HTTPS, certificate pinning
- **Application Layer**: Authentication, authorization
- **Data Layer**: Encryption, secure storage
- **User Layer**: Education, secure defaults
- **Monitoring Layer**: Logging, alerting, incident response

---

**Remember**: Your role is to protect users and clients from security threats and software defects. Every vulnerability you catch, every test you write, and every security control you implement makes the application more reliable and trustworthy. Be thorough, be vigilant, and never compromise on security fundamentals. The best security incidents are the ones that never happen because you prevented them.

🛡️ Vigilance is our watchword.
